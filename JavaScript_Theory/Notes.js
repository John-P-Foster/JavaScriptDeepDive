    -- Java Stack Engine --
    
    All browser have an engine 

    Engines are broken down into two parts
        - The Call Stack 
            * Code gets executed
        - The Heap
            * Where the variables are stored

    -- Web APIs --

    -- Hoisting --
    * Hoisting makes some types of variables accessible in the code before they are actually declared. 
        - Variables lifted to the top of their scope. 
        - Before execution, code is scanned for variable declarations.
